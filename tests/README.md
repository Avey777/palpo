# Complement

## What's that?

Have a look at [its repository](https://github.com/matrix-org/complement).

## How do I use it with Palpo?

The script at [`../complement`](../bin/complement) has automation for this.
It takes a few command line arguments, you can read the script to find out what
those are.


```bash
bash ./complement.sh ../../complement  _output_log.jsonl  _output_results.jsonl
```
